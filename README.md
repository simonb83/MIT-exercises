# MIT-exercises
My worked example from MIT Intro to Computer Science &amp; Programming (in Ruby)
In 2012 I worked through the online MIT Courseware for Introduction to Computer Science & Programming
(http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/)

Although the course was being taught in Python, I was at the time learning Ruby, so I worked through the exercises myself in Ruby.
These are my *solutions* to many of the problems.
